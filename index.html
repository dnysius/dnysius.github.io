	<p class="paragraph">Hi, I'm Dion. You can reach me on <a href="docs/writeup.pdf">LinkedIn</a>. This website is where I share my story. </p>
	<p class="paragraph">My goal is to communicate complex and nuanced technical ideas in a person-oriented and <b>accessible</b> way.</p>
	<p class="header">Tell me about yourself!<p>
	<p class="paragraph">I'm a soon-to-be recent grad from University of Toronto in Canada who obtained a BSc. in physics (read papers and wrote many reports and essays too). I frequently used Python and LaTeX throughout my studies, mostly for physics, and learned a bit of 
	R in statistics courses. Hands-on labs were my favourite courses in physics. I'm interested in mental health and wellness; taking ideas from clinical psychology research and seeing ways they can help me and people close to me. You can sometimes find me on stage playing guitar in 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqcUhHBycR0j_sKWFWx2SVg">various bands</a> where I get paid with food. Speaking of food - I love eating; here's a list of my favourite food places around the GTA.</p>
	<p class="paragraph">In 2019, I worked with Dr. Yuan Xu (and Dr. Ying Li) of Ryerson University on a <a href="docs/writeup.pdf">research project</a> 
	on industrial ultrasound imaging that involved experiment design, time series analysis, and a whole lot of <a href="http://github.com/dnysius/pure2">Python programming</a>.</p>
	<p class="paragraph">In 2016, my team participated in the University Physics Competition and earned a Bronze Medal rating.</p>
