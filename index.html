	<p class="paragraph">Hi, I'm Dion. You can reach me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dnysius/">LinkedIn</a>. This website is where I share my story. </p>
	<p class="paragraph">My goal is to communicate complex and nuanced technical ideas in a person-oriented and <b>accessible</b> way.</p>
	<p class="header">Tell me about yourself!<p>
	<p class="paragraph">I'm a soon-to-be recent grad from University of Toronto in Canada who obtained a BSc. in physics. I managed to keep up with many of my talented peers in upper-level physics courses, but I really exceled in laboratory work which involved a lot of hands-on diagnoses and analyses.
	I frequently used Python and LaTeX throughout my studies, mostly for physics, and learned a bit of R in statistics courses. I read many papers and did writings <a href="docs/VIC173-Essay2.pdf">like this one</a>.
	I'm interested in mental health and wellness; taking ideas from clinical psychology research and seeing ways they can help myself and those close to me. You can sometimes find me on stage playing guitar in 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqcUhHBycR0j_sKWFWx2SVg">various bands</a> where I get paid with food. Speaking of food, if I'm procrastinating then you'll probably find me playing with food in the kitchen or dining at some of my favourite food places around the GTA.</p>
	<p class="paragraph">In 2019, I worked with Yuan Xu, PhD. and Ying Li, PhD. of Ryerson University's Medical Biophysics department on a <a href="docs/writeup.pdf">research project</a> 
	on industrial ultrasound imaging that involved experiment design, time series analysis, and a whole lot of <a href="http://github.com/dnysius/pure2">Python programming</a>. Sometimes, all it takes is for one person to take a chance on you.</p>
	<p class="paragraph">In 2016, my team participated in the University Physics Competition and earned a Bronze Medal <a href="http://www.uphysicsc.com/2016_UPC_Results.pdf">rating</a>. 
	Life pro-tip: send your nuclear waste to the asteroid belt instead of the Sun - it's more practical and will save you <b>a lot</b> of money.</p>
