		<p class="paragraph">Hi, I'm Dion. You can reach me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dnysius/">LinkedIn</a>. This website is where I share my story. </p>
		<p class="paragraph">My goal is to communicate complex and nuanced technical ideas in a person-oriented and <b>accessible</b> way.</p>
		<p class="header">Tell me about yourself!<p>
		<p class="paragraph">     I’m a recent grad who achieved a BSc. in physics at University of Toronto, with minors in both statistics and maths. My goal is to make big ideas more accessible and human-centric through storytelling. 
		I’ve studied countless formulas and concepts, investigated many phenonema through experimentation, and used computational techniques to analyze data, all throughout my undergraduate program.</p>
 
        <p class="paragraph">I’m currently transitioning onto a digital transformation career path, where I can leverage my multifaceted skillset to help companies and causes not get left behind - by adapting to the rapidly developing technological landscape.</p>
	 
		<p class="paragraph">I managed to keep up with many of my talented peers in upper-level physics courses, but I really exceled in laboratory work which involved a lot of hands-on diagnoses and analyses.
		I frequently used Python and LaTeX throughout my studies, mostly for physics, and learned a bit of R in statistics courses. 
		I've read many papers and did writings <a href="docs/VIC173-Essay2.pdf">like this one here</a> and <a href="docs/essay.docx">this one</a>.
		I'm interested in mental health and wellness; taking ideas from clinical psychology research and seeing ways they can help myself and those close to me. You can sometimes find me on stage playing guitar in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqcUhHBycR0j_sKWFWx2SVg">various bands</a> where I get paid with food. 
		Speaking of food: you'll probably catch me playing with food in the kitchen or dining at some of my favourite food places around the GTA whenever I'm taking a break.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">In 2020, I took two statistics courses, one on regression analysis (final report <a href="docs/STA302_Report.pdf">here</a>) and one on machine learning (first project <a href="xstitch/">here</a>, second project <a href="logistic_lasso/">here</a>).</p>
		<p class="paragraph">In 2019, I worked with Yuan Xu, PhD. and Ying Li, PhD. of Ryerson University's Medical Biophysics department on a <a href="docs/writeup.pdf">research project</a> 
		on industrial ultrasound imaging that involved experiment design, time series analysis, and a whole lot of <a href="http://github.com/dnysius/pure2">Python programming</a>. Sometimes, all it takes is for one person to take a chance on you.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">In 2018, I helped out with the Physics department's first-ever <a href="https://www9.physics.utoronto.ca/physics-at-uoft/outreach/doors-open-toronto/#Doors_Open_Photos_2018">Doors Open Toronto</a> event. 
		Dr. Stephen Morris of the Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Physics research group is well-known on the internet as the <a href="img/dominos.jpg">domino-effect meme</a>; this is one of the demonstrations that I've conducted and is performed at virtually every outreach event hosted by the department.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">In 2016, my team participated in the University Physics Competition and earned a Bronze Medal <a href="http://www.uphysicsc.com/2016_UPC_Results.pdf">rating</a>. 
		Life pro-tip: send your nuclear waste to the asteroid belt instead of the Sun - it's more practical and will save you <b>a lot</b> of money.</p>
